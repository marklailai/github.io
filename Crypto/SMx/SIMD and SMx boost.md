# SIMD Acceleration on x86 and ARM: Boosting SM2, SM3, and SM4 Cryptography

Cryptography is at the heart of modern secure systems. Whether you're implementing VPNs, TLS, digital signatures, or national standards like China's **SM2**, **SM3**, and **SM4**, **performance matters**. And one of the best-kept secrets to achieving high throughput is using **SIMD** instructions.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore how **AVX2** (on x86) and **NEON** (on ARM) can supercharge cryptographic operationsâ€”specifically for SM2, SM3, and SM4. Weâ€™ll dive deep into implementation strategies, performance techniques, and common pitfalls.

## What is SIMD?

**SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** is a CPU feature that allows parallel processing of multiple data elements using a single instruction. Instead of looping over individual operations, SIMD processes **vectors of data** simultaneouslyâ€”ideal for data-parallel problems like encryption or hashing.

### Examples:

- Encrypting **4 or 8 SM4 blocks** in parallel.
- Hashing **multiple SM3 message blocks** concurrently.
- Accelerating **large-number modular arithmetic** in SM2 with vectorized multiplications.

## ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ SM2/SM3/SM4 Overview

### SM2 â€“ Public-Key ECC

- Based on elliptic curve over GF(p)
- Used for digital signatures, encryption, key exchange
- Computational bottlenecks:
  - Big-number modular arithmetic (256-bit integers)
  - Scalar-point multiplication

### SM3 â€“ Cryptographic Hash Function

- Similar to SHA-256
- Operates on 512-bit message blocks
- 64 compression rounds
- Suitable for SIMD-based **message-parallel** or **round-parallel** acceleration

### SM4 â€“ Block Cipher

- 128-bit block size, 128-bit key
- 32 rounds of substitution-permutation network (SPN)
- Perfect for **block-parallel** SIMD encryption (like AES-NI)
