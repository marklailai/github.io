##  Why Use a Trading Bot?

Manual trading has serious limitations:

- You can't trade 24/7.
- Emotions interfere with decisions.
- You can’t easily backtest or optimize trades before running them.

With a bot like Freqtrade, you can:

-  Trade automatically based on pre-defined logic  
-  Backtest strategies on historical data  
-  Optimize strategies with hyperparameter tuning  
-  Run the bot safely in simulation (dry-run) before going live  
-  Monitor performance via Telegram or Web UI
